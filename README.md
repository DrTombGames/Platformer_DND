## Contributing

That's awesome just like no stuff that kids can't see. What I mean by that is that I'm purposefully making this project **non-violence-ish** and **no curse words**. Which I really got to watch out for `cause I do curse a lot XD. Also, this is a **template** for others to make there game on top of so lets try to make things **easy too use**. Not sure how to do that yet cause you know, games are actually really hard to make.


## Contributers
